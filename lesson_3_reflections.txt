When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all you work local?

You would want to create a remote repository any time that something is to be gained by having the repository 
be available online, both to yourself and others.  A time that might fall into this category would be when 
you are using multiple computers throughout the day, say doing some work from work and some from a home computer.
Another would be if the project that you are working on is collaborative in nature, and you wanted to make 
the repository available to other involved in the project.
